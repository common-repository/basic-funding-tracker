== Description ==
Basic Funding Tracker is a simple widget that lets you display the progress toward a fundraising goal on your site. It provides a basic design & layout that is easy to customize with CSS if you're looking for a particular look or want to integrate it with your theme.

You just enter the goal and the current amount, then the widget takes care of everything else, including a display of the amount remaining to be raised. 

Feel free to fork the plugin if you'd like to make adjustments to make it fit your related or unrelated needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I change the color of the funding status, or otherwise tweak the design? =
Use Additional CSS in the customizer to tweak the design.

To change the color, for example, you'll need something like:
`.widget .funding-goal-current {
	background: darkblue;
}`
